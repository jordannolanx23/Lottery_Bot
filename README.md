# Lottery_Bot
This is a personal Project of a powerball quessing robot. I use this program to test out GUI develoupment on python and to run and test my AI algorithims. the lottery is a perfect playground for this kind of work because it has years worth of data and to this day is unpredictable although it runs based on its own algorithim. feel free to take any code here and use it for your own work/ add to it and give advice. this code is ment to be an open playground. please keep all code consistant with documentation and testing. Also source all work and references to proper code authors.
